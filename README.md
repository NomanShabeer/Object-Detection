# Object-Detection
An Object Detector based on Python and Tensorflow API

# Object Detection using OpenCV and MobileNet SSD

## Introduction

This project demonstrates object detection using OpenCV and the MobileNet SSD model. It can detect a wide range of objects in images, making it useful for various applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
(https://github.com/NomanShabeer/Object-Detection.git)
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

To perform object detection on an image, you can use the following command:

```bash

## Model

We use the MobileNet SSD model, which is a pre-trained deep learning model for object detection. The model configuration and weights are included in this repository.

## Classes

The model can detect various objects, including:

- Person
- Bicycle
- Car
- Motorbike
- Aeroplane
- ... (list continues)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib



## Acknowledgments

- The MobileNet SSD model was trained on the COCO dataset.
